    <description>FormFutura's BVOH - Butenediol Vinyl Alcohol Co-polymer - 
        3D printer filament is an advanced water-soluble support material for 
        complex multi-extrusion 3D printing. BVOH bonds to nearly all 
        'build materials' and it dissolves in water at a faster rate than PVA support materials. 
        Its thermal stability is optimized to eliminate any risk of your hot-end clogging up by thermal degradation.

        Key features
        Good bonding with nearly all 'build materials'
        Excellent solubility in water
        Resistant to thermal degradation through optimized melt flow properties
        Eco-friendly
        Waste can be disposed of by flushing it (with water) through any regular household drain 

        Applications
        Reliable multi-extrusion 3D printing of complex structures that require a water-soluble support material
        3D printing geometries with large overhangs or complex hollow structures
        PVA molds

    <adhesion_info>General printing guidelines *
        Nozzle side: ≥ 0.15mm
        layer height: ≥ 0.1mm
        Experience level: Expert
        Print temp: ± 200 - 230° C
        Fan speed: 0 - 30%
        Heat bed: ± 65 - 75° C
        Enclosure needed: No
        *) Above displayed settings are meant as guidance to find your optimal print settings. These ranges in settings should work for most printers, but please do feel free to experiment outside these parameters if you think it is suitable for your printer. There are a lot of different type of printers, hot-ends, and printer offset that it is extremely difficult to give an overall one-size-fits-all setting.
        *) Do not exceed a printing temperature of 230˚C for a prolonged period of time.
        *) Once BVOH has been used or opened from its original vacuum-sealed packaging for a while it is advised to dry the material before using again.

These include low melting points, high stretching characteristics and high gas barrier performance, as well as low foaming, aqueous solution stability and emulsification performance. -->
